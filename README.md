# Evasion
Created as part of the unit COMP2160 - Game Development at Macquarie University

Playable Game is in the Game Builds folder.

**Description:** Evasion was a simple game that was made to exhibit simple gameplay programming skills and code architecture. This assignment and project was built as a clone to a specification that was put forth by the university. In short, it is a simple evade and shoot game. The player can destroy the enemy to collect coins and increase their high score.

**Contributions**:
- The entire project is my own including all code and design (Concept was the university's. Researched solutions have credits to coder via in code comments.)
