Things to Note***
- I used PlayerPrefs to save score data instead of managing it through DontDestroyOnLoad
- I used a guide to understand the camera bounds, code used is referenced in the source code
- I tried to use methods learned from lectures, I used a few different methods outside of lectures using the API, I hope this is ok and good practice for the industry
- I used OnBecameInvisible to destroy objects. Again not sure if this is ok as it strays from lecture content.
